# 🌑 ObscuraTrace: Hidden Blockchain Risk Detection

**ObscuraTrace** is an AI-powered forensic tool designed to uncover hidden threats, track suspicious behavior, and enhance transactional safety across blockchain environments.

## 🔑 Key Features

### 🕶️ StealthGuard  
Detects under-the-radar blockchain activity such as stealth whale entries, layered transfers, and disguised wash trades.

### 🕵️‍♂️ ShadowTrack  
Monitors behavioral anomalies — flags suspicious shifts like rug pulls, coordinated exits, or rapid token dumps.

### ⚠️ CrypticAlert  
Identifies high-risk trades based on liquidity impact, transaction timing, and directional slippage that may signal manipulative intent.

### 🌐 SignalNet  
Cross-references wallet actions with global blockchain signals to identify behavioral clusters, bot loops, or phishing funnels.

## 🧠 AI Modules

ObscuraTrace operates through a suite of intelligent detection modules that monitor, flag, and predict suspicious behavior in blockchain activity. Below are the core AI-driven systems:

### 🛰 1. StealthGuard — Hidden Transaction Monitoring  
**Language:** JavaScript

```javascript
function stealthGuard(transactionData) {
  const stealthScore = (transactionData.amount / transactionData.volume) * Math.pow(transactionData.tokenAge, 0.5);

  const threshold = 2;
  if (stealthScore > threshold) {
    return 'Alert: Hidden Transaction Detected';
  } else {
    return 'Transaction Visible';
  }
}
```
#### How it works:
Goal: Catch transactions flying under the radar
Method:
- Take the transaction amount
- Divide by total token volume
- Multiply by √(token age)
Trigger: If the score exceeds 2, the trade is flagged

#### Why it matters:
Useful for detecting stealth whale entries, wash trades, or front-running in low-liquidity markets.

### 🕵️‍♂️ 2. ShadowTrack — AI-Powered Anomaly Detection

```javascript
function shadowTrack(transactionData) {
  const deviation = Math.abs(transactionData.currentFlow - transactionData.previousFlow) / transactionData.previousFlow;

  if (deviation > 0.5) {
    return 'Alert: Anomalous Behavior Detected';
  } else {
    return 'Behavior Normal';
  }
}
```
#### How it works:
- Goal: Detect sudden spikes or drops in transactional behavior
- Method: Measure the relative change in transaction flow
- Trigger: If deviation > 50%, it’s flagged as an anomaly

#### Why it matters:
Early warning system for rug pulls, panic sells, or flash pump attempts.

### ⚠️ 3. CrypticAlert — Real-Time Risk Identification

```javascript
function crypticAlert(transactionData) {
  const volumeRiskFactor = transactionData.amount / transactionData.volume;
  const isSuspicious = volumeRiskFactor > 0.7;

  if (isSuspicious) {
    return 'Alert: High-Risk Transaction Detected';
  } else {
    return 'Transaction Normal';
  }
}
```
#### How it works:
- Goal: Flag trades with outsized market impact
- Method: Ratio of transaction amount to total volume
- Trigger: If the ratio > 0.7, it’s flagged

#### Why it matters:
Identifies single transactions capable of draining liquidity or triggering manipulation.

### 🌐 4. DarkNetProbe — Suspicious Activity Analysis

```javascript
function darkNetProbe(transactionData) {
  const suspectThreshold = 1_000_000; // high-value cutoff
  let activityRisk = 0;

  if (transactionData.tokenMovement > suspectThreshold) {
    activityRisk = 1;
  }

  if (activityRisk === 1) {
    return 'Alert: Suspicious Activity Detected';
  } else {
    return 'Activity Normal';
  }
}
```
#### How it works:
- Goal: Detect massive and unusual token movements
- Method: Compare token movement against a high-value threshold
- Trigger: If the threshold (e.g. 1,000,000 tokens) is crossed

#### Why it matters:
Essential for spotting bridge exploits, laundering attempts, or exit scams before they complete.
